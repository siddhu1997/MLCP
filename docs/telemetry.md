# 📊 MLCP Telemetry Specification (v0.1)

This document defines what telemetry is collected within MLCP and how it is used to drive decisions in orchestration, forecasting, and cost control.

---

## 🧩 Purpose of Telemetry

- Track agent performance
- Monitor token and cost usage
- Enable temporal predictions
- Flag misbehaving or underperforming agents
- Support auditability and observability

---

## 🔍 What We Track

### Per Agent Invocation
- `agent_id`
- `task_id`
- `timestamp`
- `tokens_used`
- `latency_ms`
- `model_name`
- `outcome_rating` (0–5)

### Per Task
- Total tokens consumed
- Agent hop count
- Completion time
- Acceptance criteria met: true/false

### Per Sprint
- Total cost
- Number of context packets exchanged
- Agents involved
- Forecast accuracy (if applicable)

---

## 🗃️ Storage Plan

- Stored in MongoDB collection: `telemetry_logs`
- Indexed by `task_id`, `agent_id`, `sprint_id`
- Optionally sampled (see `mlcp.yaml -> telemetry.sample_rate`)

---

## 🧠 Future Ideas

- Integrate with Prometheus + Grafana for live dashboards
- Create reputation scores per agent
- Use telemetry to auto-adjust agent budgets or routing
- Track context growth and token compression savings
